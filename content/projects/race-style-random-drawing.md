Science is a very collaborative process, but not all of the tasks are
particularly fun (e.g., putting an EEG cap on a research subject). To help
encourage everyone in the lab to help each other out, we've developed a simple
reward system. Anytime someone helps out another lab member with something, they
get a point on the scoreboard. At the end of the month we have a drawing. Each
persons name gets entered into the drawing as many times as they have points
(i.e., more points == more chances to win). We then pick a winner and everyone
else in the lab takes that person out for drinks.

We used to just use a hat and scraps of paper, the old fashioned way. We got
tired of ripping up perfectly good scratch paper, and decided to go high-tech.
Inspired by the horse-racing game at the WI State Fair, I coded up a
browser-based race-style random drawing app. Each person picks a character, a
color, and enters their point total for the month. When everyone is on the line,
we run the race (purely random steps forward), and the first to cross the line
wins!

You can have your own races [here][demo]. Should you want to change anything about it
(e.g., add new icons), the code is available on [GitHub][repo].
