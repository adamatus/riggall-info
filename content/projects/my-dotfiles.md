These days I'm using a fork of Yan Pritzker's ([skwp][skwp]) excellent 
[Yet Another Dotfile Repo (YADR)][yadr]. The core of this setup is the trio of 
zsh, Vim, and tmux. The repo includes a number of nice Vim plugins, which 
I've supplemented with a number of additional Python-specific plugins.

You can access my fork on [GitHub][repo].
