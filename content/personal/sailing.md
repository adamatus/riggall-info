Every time I go out on the water (or ice), I'm amazed at the power of the wind
and the ingenuity of sailors over the years to harness it. The technology in
sailing these days is amazing (see the AC72s from the recent America's Cup or
[Vestas Sail Rocket 2][sailrocket]), but it is equally fun to cruise around 
in a decades old boat (or early generation Windsurfer).

I grew up sailing on a Sunfish and Barnett 1400. Since then I've tried to expose
myself to as many different boats as possible, including a variety of dinghies
(Laser, 420, Byte), keelboats (J/22, J/24, Capri 22, New York 36, Mull 34),
scows (C, E, I-20), and even iceboats (DN) and remote-controlled boats (Odom).
The only thing I'm missing is a proper catamaran experience, so if you've got a
cat and want to sail, get it touch!

I'm also a huge fan of windsurfing. I'm still learning, but get better every
time I go out. I've also taken to snowkiting in the winters. One of these days
I'll get out on the water with the kite.
