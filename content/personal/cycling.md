Like many kids, I grew up biking around the neighborhood. In high school and
college I dabbled in mountain biking. But it wasn't until I arrived in Madison
that I fully fell in love with biking. It's amazing how much ground you can
cover, how many interesting things you'll pass, and how great you'll feel after
a long ride. These days I bike commute everywhere and try to get out on longs
rides as often as possible.

In the past couple of years I've done several very fun fundraising rides,
including the [Scenic Shore 150][ss] and [Bike the Barns][btb].

You can check out [this fun video][ss-vid] my team put together during the 
last Scenic Shore.
